# This quick note details how it is possible to do coverage tests on the
# cado source tree.

# I'm adding this to my local.sh file:

if [ "$COV" ] ; then
build_tree="${build_tree}.cov"
DEBUG=1
CFLAGS="-O0 -g -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage"
CXXFLAGS="-O0 -g -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage"
fi

# (of course, your mileage may vary, depending on how you like to setup
# your local.sh file).

# I'm compiling cado with COV=1 make -j 32

# Then I do:

./build/x86_64.cov/run_example.sh c59

# Now I use the lcov package, and its geninfo/genhtml scripts.

andouille ~/NFS/cado $ /tmp/geninfo --no-checksum --ignore-errors gcov,source  -q --output-filename cado-nfs.info ./build/x86_64.cov/
andouille ~/NFS/cado $ genhtml -o ~/.webdir/cado/ cado-nfs.info 

# And go to http://www.loria.fr/~thome/cado (which happens to be where an
# apache server serves the location ~/.webdir/cado/ ; of course this is
# only my very own setup).


Note that in order to not discard reports about the system include files, it is better to to a checkout in a fresh directory. See ./scripts/coverage-nightly.sh for that.
